# Rover

Hands and eyes on a real mobile device, for coding agents — and a way to share those devices
between several agents working at once.

An agent can build a mobile app but cannot look at it. Rover taps, scrolls, types, screenshots,
reads the view hierarchy, records video and toggles the network, over `adb`. A daemon keeps one
inventory of the machine's devices so two agents never end up driving the same phone.

It is **not** a test framework. Nothing asserts, nothing turns red on its own, nothing is a CI
gate. Rover moves the device and reports what is on it; judging whether that is right is the
agent's job.

## Status

Design and rules are settled. The toolchain and the device-backend contract — the device
interface, the Zod capability manifest and the registry a backend joins through one import — are
in place, and the Android backend is registered. The daemon runs: it binds a unix socket, serves
the schema-checked IPC surface over it, and **starts itself on the first call**, with two
concurrent callers producing exactly one daemon. It now holds a **device inventory** — one entry
per device, fed by each registered backend's change stream, refusing anything attached to another
host — and answers `list_devices` alongside `status`. The inventory is a cache and never the
authority: a lease re-verifies its device against the backend at grant time (`PROJECT.md` D6),
and `list_devices` says `stale` whenever the list is not known to be current.

**Leases work.** `acquire_device` grants one device — not the whole machine — to an explicit
caller-supplied `owner` string, alongside a `project` and an optional `test_name` the host stores
and never inspects. The lease runs on a 20-minute TTL **renewed by activity rather than by a
heartbeat**, so an agent that pauses to think keeps its device and one that died lets go on its
own. A busy device is a refusal that names who holds it and for how much longer, never an error,
and never the holder's lease id; `release_device` hands it back. Five clients asking at once get
exactly one winner. `list_devices` names each device's holder the same way — the owner, project and
test name, and how much longer they have, or nothing at all for a free device — and never the lease
id, which is what ends a lease and belongs only to whoever was granted it.

**The daemon restores the device itself** (D9) — on `release_device` and on expiry alike, from the
one place a lease is observed to end. It stops the project's applications, turns airplane mode off,
turns wifi back on (in that order: `PROJECT.md` §6 records why the wifi step has to be last) and
runs the project's teardown hook. A caller is never asked to do any of it and cannot opt out; a
step that fails is reported and the remaining steps still run — including a project resolver that
throws, which costs that project's own steps and never the device's; and a device is never handed
to the next lessee while its restoration is still in flight. An unref'ed sweep is what notices a
lease whose holder died — such an agent issues no further calls, so nothing else would ever ask —
and shutting the daemon down sweeps once more and then waits, bounded, for whatever it still owes:
leases die with the host, so a restoration abandoned there is one nothing will ever retry. Which
applications a project owns and what its hook does arrive through an injected resolver — the
per-project configuration that fills it is its own issue (`PROJECT.md` §9.3, R17), so today that
resolver answers nothing and only the two network steps have work to do.

**There is a CLI** (D4) — `rover list`, `acquire`, `release` and `status`, human-readable by
default and one JSON document on stdout with `--json`, every diagnostic on stderr. It holds no
verb logic: each command parses flags, calls one IPC method, renders the answer and picks an exit
code. `list` shows what is attached, what is free and who holds the rest — the owner, project and
test name, and how much longer they have — and says out loud when the host does not know its own
view to be current, rather than quietly printing a short list. `acquire` requires an explicit
`--owner` and `--project` and derives neither. `status` says which host answered. The host is named
by `--host`; no flag means the local one, and `local` is the only value reachable until the network
listener lands (`PROJECT.md` R22), so anything else fails loudly instead of hanging.

One gap is worth stating plainly: `src/daemon/main.ts` does not yet import the backend barrel, so
a daemon started with `npm run daemon` runs with an empty registry and answers an empty device
list — `rover list` against it prints "no devices are attached" on a machine with a phone plugged
in. That wiring is its own issue. The backlog is twenty issues in dependency order — see
[`PROJECT.md`](PROJECT.md) §9.3.

```bash
npm run rover -- status              # start the daemon if it is not running, report which host answered
npm run rover -- list                # what is attached, what is free, who holds the rest
npm run rover -- acquire <serial> --owner issue-112 --project rover
npm run rover -- release <lease-id>
npm run rover -- --help              # the four commands, the global flags and the exit codes
npm run daemon                       # run the daemon in the foreground instead, to watch it start
```

`npm run` prints its own banner to stdout ahead of the command, so a script that parses the JSON
uses `npm run -s rover -- list --json` or invokes `node --import tsx/esm src/cli/index.ts list
--json` directly. There is no `bin/` launcher yet — the published entry point is `PROJECT.md` R20's
to settle.

Exit codes: `0` success; `1` the operation did not succeed (a refused `acquire`, a `release` that
found no live lease, an unreachable host, a request the host rejected); `2` usage error (unknown
command or flag, a missing `--owner`/`--project`, a `--host` nothing can reach yet). A `release`
that found nothing exits `1` on purpose — the host cannot tell "no such id" from "already gone",
and exiting `0` would let a mistyped lease id read as success.

Stopping the daemon is `kill <pid>` on the pid `rover status` printed; it unlinks its socket on
the way out, and the next call brings a new one up.

## Configuration

Host-level settings come from the environment. Every row here mirrors a Zod schema, which is the
source of truth for what a valid value is (`ai/RULES.md` §7) — the daemon and the CLI both fail at
startup, naming the variable and the reason, rather than binding something surprising.

| Variable | Default | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `ROVER_SOCKET_PATH` | `~/.rover/rover.sock` | Absolute path of the unix socket the local daemon binds and a local client connects to. **Empty counts as unset** — an exported-but-blank variable is what a shell leaves behind, and reading it as a real setting would point the daemon at the current directory. At most **103 bytes of UTF-8**: a unix socket address is a fixed-size struct (104 bytes on macOS, 108 on Linux, NUL included), and over the cap `bind` truncates or answers `EINVAL` instead of naming the length, so a longer path is rejected at startup with the byte count and the path. |

While a daemon is coming up over a socket a crashed one left behind, a `<socket>.reclaim` lock file
may briefly appear beside it. It is removed by whoever took it, and any left behind by a killed
process is discarded on age by the next start.

## Where things are

| Document | What it answers |
|---|---|
| [`PROJECT.md`](PROJECT.md) | Why this exists, the sixteen decisions and their reasoning, the verb set, verified adb recipes, the backlog |
| [`ai/RULES.md`](ai/RULES.md) | The single source of truth for agents working in this repo — read it first |
| [`ai/ARCHITECTURE.md`](ai/ARCHITECTURE.md) | The four components, the lease lifecycle, where the iOS seam runs |
| [`ai/CODING_STANDARDS.md`](ai/CODING_STANDARDS.md) | Stack, Zod boundaries, error handling, module shape |
| [`ai/TESTING.md`](ai/TESTING.md) | Vitest, the real-device gate, fixtures, conformance |

In the source tree: `src/core/` holds the device contract and the branded ids, `src/backends/` one
folder per platform, `src/ipc/` the wire protocol and the transport-agnostic client and server,
`src/daemon/` the socket and the inventory and the leases, and `src/cli/` the `rover` command.

## Shape

Four parts. A **daemon**, one per machine, owning the device inventory, the leases and state
restoration. A **core** library holding the device abstraction and the verbs. A **CLI**, and an
**MCP server** — one per agent — as two adapters onto that same core.

The daemon exists because two agents have two separate MCP servers that cannot see each other,
while the devices are shared. Without it, an unpinned install reaches every attached device and
one agent screenshots the other's build.

## Working on this repo

Read `ai/RULES.md` in full first. `npm install` sets up the toolchain and installs the git hooks;
`npm run verify` (lint, typecheck, unit tests) is the one command that says whether the tree is
healthy. Issues are filed with `/write-issue` and implemented with
`/solve-issue`; both are committed under `.claude/skills/`. Work is also delegated to
[Swarm](https://github.com/SmartTechBrewery/swarm), which is why every issue carries the `swarm`
label.

/**
 * Device-layer error types.
 *
 * "This device cannot do that" and "this broke" call for opposite responses from an
 * agent, so a missing capability is its own type rather than a generic `Error`
 * (ai/CODING_STANDARDS.md "Error handling", D11). Everything else in this layer throws
 * plain `Error` for a programmer or validation bug, and returns `null` for not-found.
 *
 * Imports from `./capabilities.js` are type-only on purpose: that module imports this
 * one for its value, so an erased edge is what keeps the pair free of a runtime cycle.

/**
 * Thrown when a verb needs a capability the device's backend does not declare.

 * Names the capability, the device and the backend, because that is what tells the

 * throwing this: a plausible-looking empty result where the honest answer is "this
 * device cannot do that" is the failure the capability model exists to prevent.

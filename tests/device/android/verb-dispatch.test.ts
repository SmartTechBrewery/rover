/**
 * Host-side verb execution (D19, R21) against a real device: a daemon on a socket, a lease
 * taken over it, and a verb dispatched by the process that owns the hardware.
 *
 * `tests/unit/daemon/verb-dispatch.test.ts` proves the dispatch over a fake backend, and
 * `tests/unit/no-backend-in-a-client.test.ts` proves a client cannot reach one. Neither
 * proves the join — that the socket, a real device re-verified through its backend, the
 * registry lookup and the answer coming back all hold against hardware in front of you. That
 * is all this suite is for, and it is why it is short.
 *
 * **This is the first suite in `tests/device/` that takes its lease from a running daemon**
 * (ai/TESTING.md, "The exemption"), which is the shape the others convert to.
 *
 * **What this deliberately does not cover, so silence is not read as "checked":**
 *
 * - **No real screen is read.** The backend honestly declares `canReadScreen: false` until
 *   `read_screen` lands (R13), so both waits answer `missing-capability` — which is itself the
 *   assertion below, because a loud, structured refusal naming the real device and the real
 *   backend is exactly what D11 asks of a capability nothing backs. When that flag flips, this
 *   suite gains the two assertions it cannot make today: a wait that resolves off a real read,
 *   and one that times out naming what was on screen instead.
 * - What *is* proved against the hardware is everything either side of the screen read: the
 *   daemon lends this machine's own device over a socket, derives it from the lease id,
 *   re-verifies it through its backend on every call (D6), reaches the verb layer with a
 *   context built from it, and brings the answer back as data.
 *
 * **Read-only**, so `ROVER_TEST_DEVICE` and not the local-only gate: it changes no setting and
 * touches no radio. Its lease is released in `afterEach`.
